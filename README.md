# Docker 101 Series üê≥
Welcome to **Docker 101**, a beginner-friendly series designed to help you learn Docker from scratch. This repository will guide you through the core concepts of containerization, how to build, manage, and deploy containerized applications effectively, and provide hands-on exercises to solidify your learning.

## üìã What You Will Learn:
- What Docker is and why containerization is important.
- Setting up Docker on your machine.
- Understanding Docker images and containers.
- Building and managing Docker images with Dockerfile.
- Networking in Docker: connecting containers.
- Docker Compose for multi-container applications.
- Best practices for Dockerfile and image management.
- Hands-on projects to reinforce your learning.
