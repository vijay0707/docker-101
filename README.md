## üìò Modules Overview

### Module 1: [Introduction to Docker](./01-introduction)
Learn what Docker is, how it compares to virtual machines, and why containerization is a game changer. This module covers Docker‚Äôs architecture and helps you get Docker set up on your machine.

**Hands-on Exercise**: Running your first Docker container with `hello-world`.

---

### Module 2: [Docker Basics & Commands](./02-basic-commands)
Get familiar with the most essential Docker commands! Learn how to create, run, stop, and remove containers, as well as manage Docker images and logs.

**Hands-on Exercise**: Running an `nginx` container, inspecting logs, and stopping the container.

---

### Module 3: [Docker Images & Dockerfile](./03-images-dockerfile)
Understand how Docker images work and how to create your own using a `Dockerfile`. This module explains best practices for writing Dockerfiles and building efficient images.

**Hands-on Exercise**: Write a Dockerfile for a simple web application and build your own custom image.

---

### Module 4: [Volumes & Persistent Storage](./04-volumes)
Learn how to manage persistent data using Docker volumes. In this module, you‚Äôll see how to store data across container restarts and share data between containers.

**Hands-on Exercise**: Create a containerized database with persistent storage using Docker volumes.

---

### Module 5: [Networking in Docker](./05-networking)
Understand Docker networking and how to connect containers together. Explore bridge networks, host networks, and how to expose container ports.

**Hands-on Exercise**: Create a multi-container network (e.g., a web server and database) and connect them using Docker networking.

---

### Module 6: [Docker Compose](./06-docker-compose)
Docker Compose simplifies managing multi-container applications. This module will guide you through defining services with `docker-compose.yml` files and how to manage them.

**Hands-on Exercise**: Create a `docker-compose.yml` file for a full-stack application (e.g., frontend, backend, and database).

---

### Module 7: [CI/CD with Docker](./07-ci-cd)
Integrate Docker into your Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines. Learn how Docker can be used to automate the building and deployment of your applications.

**Hands-on Exercise**: Build and push a Docker image automatically in a CI pipeline using GitHub Actions or Jenkins.

---

## üéØ Projects & Real-World Use Cases

### Project 1: [Dockerizing a Simple Web Application](./projects/web-app-dockerized)
Learn how to containerize a simple web application (e.g., a Node.js or Python app) using Docker, Docker Compose, and persistent storage.

### Project 2: [Dockerizing a Microservices Architecture](./projects/microservices-architecture)
Containerize a microservices-based architecture with Docker Compose and container networking. Build and deploy multiple services that work together in a containerized environment.
